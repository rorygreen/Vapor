# mist

*mist* is a minimal and responsive theme for the [Ghost Blogging Platform](http://ghost.org/). It was originally forked from the [Vapor](https://github.com/sethlilly/Vapor) theme by [Seth Lilly](https://github.com/sethlilly) and so shares a similar style with the original.

Supports blog and user images; cover images, while supported in the Ghost admin, are not displayed in the theme due to theme's minimal nature and focus on typography.

Fonts embedded via Google Fonts, including Roboto Slab, Merriweather, and Open Sans Condensed.

The Ghost, Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ icons are trademarks of their respective owners and are from the Casper theme, copyright (c) 2013 Ghost Foundation and released under The MIT License.

Other icons provided by [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) and released under SIL OFL 1.1.

## Customisation

A [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) file is included which contains variables allowing you to quickly change the theme's stylesheet. This can be compiled using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) by issuing `grunt build` at the command line.
